## Demo Site

A basic next.js project (my preferred react framework) demonstrating how Accordio can be used. In this demo I have wrapped it in a component (AccordioWrapper) to demonstrate real life usage if you needed to create multiple instances without the code repitition.

### Installation

Run an `npm install` and then run `npm run dev` to run the demo and see accordio in action!
